# Capacitor game**

An interactive parallel-plate capacitor simulator that allows users to explore the relationship between plate size, separation, dielectric constant, and the resulting capacitance, stored charge, and electric field.

## Features

- **Interactive Controls**: Adjust plate size, separation, dielectric constant, and applied voltage in real-time
- **Real-time Calculations**: See immediate updates to capacitance, stored charge, and electric field
- **Visual Feedback**: The capacitor visualization changes dynamically based on your adjustments
- **Clean UI**: Simple black background with white capacitor elements for a minimalist design

## How to Use

1. **Plate Size**: Adjust the area of the capacitor plates 
2. **Separation**: Change the distance between plates
3. **Dielectric Constant**: Modify the dielectric material
4. **Applied Voltage**: Set the voltage across the capacitor

## Physics Formulas

- **Capacitance**: C = ε₀εᵣA/d
  - ε₀ = Permittivity of free space (8.8 × 10⁻¹² F/m)
  - εᵣ = Relative permittivity (dielectric constant)
  - A = Plate area
  - d = Plate separation

- **Stored Charge**: Q = CV
- **Electric Field**: E = V/d
